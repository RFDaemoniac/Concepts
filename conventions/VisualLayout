Keep origins of children meaningful
	arbitrary offsets that then need to be offset back quickly make it hard to position things
	
Try to pick a spacing convention and stick to it
	i.e. everything will have 0 upper and right margin by default
	or everything will have a margin of 5 on all sides
	so that every kind of sibling can be re-orderable.

If creating something that will be overridden
	try to make the parts the change as few and seperate as possible

Layering views where some views are used in multiple contexts, both for re-use and separation

Keeping the visual state machine simple is probably better than enabling very complex flows
